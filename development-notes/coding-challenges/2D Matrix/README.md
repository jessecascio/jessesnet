2D Matrix
===================

Source: Coding Interviews: Questions, Analysis, and Solutions

(1) In a 2-D matrix, every row is increasingly sorted from left to right, and every column is increasingly sorted from top to bottom. Please implement a function to check whether a number is in such a matrix or not. For example, all rows and columns are increasingly sorted in the following matrix. It returns true if it tries to find number 7, but it returns false if it tries to find number 5.

```
1 2 8 9
2 4 9 12
4 7 10 13
6 8 11 15
```
